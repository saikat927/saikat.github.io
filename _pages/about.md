I am an **Assistant Professor** in the **Department of Computer Science, Bangabasi College**, University of Calcutta. I received my **Ph.D. degree from the University of Calcutta in 2024**. Prior to joining academia, I accumulated **three years of professional experience as a Software Developer** in the IT industry.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning**, with a particular focus on **sports analytics** and **geometry-aware visual understanding**. I am especially interested in designing **robust and deployable vision systems** for real-world scenarios. My recent research centers on **automatic virtual advertisement insertion in soccer broadcast videos**, where I address challenges related to camera motion, homography estimation, and foreground–background separation.

In parallel, I am involved in **industry-oriented research projects**, including **vision-based steel surface defect detection and classification** and **burden shift estimation in coal blast furnaces**. These works leverage **weakly supervised learning** and **multi-instance learning frameworks** to improve reliability and scalability in practical inspection environments.

I actively serve as a **reviewer** for several reputed journals, including **IEEE Transactions on Multimedia**, **Springer Nature Computer Science**, and **Springer Journal of *Sādhanā***.
