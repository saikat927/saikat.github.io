I am an **Assistant Professor** with the **Department of Computer Science, Bangabasi College**, University of Calcutta. I received my **Ph.D. degree from the University of Calcutta in 2024**. Prior to joining academia, I gained **three years of professional experience as a Software Developer** in IT industry.

My research interests include **computer vision in sports analytics**, **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and **large language models**, with a strong emphasis on designing robust, geometry-aware visual systems for real-world deployment. My recent work focuses on **automatic virtual advertisement insertion in soccer broadcast videos**. In parallel, I am working on two industrial projects, **vision-based steel surface defect detection and classification** and **estimation of burden shift of coal blust furnace**, leveraging weakly supervised and multi-instance learning techniques to improve reliability in practical inspection systems.

I actively serve as a **reviewer** for reputed journals, including **IEEE Transactions on Multimedia**, **Springer Nature Computer Science**, and **Springer Journal of Sādhanā**.
